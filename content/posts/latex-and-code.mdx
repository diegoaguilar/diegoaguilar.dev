This blog supports code syntax highlighting through `prism-react-renderer` and the usage of $\LaTeX$ via `gatsby-remark-katex`

However $\KaTeX$ (the library used to render) $\LaTeX$ will crash your development environment if it encounters a symbol it is unfamiliar with. Make sure you test your posts locally before publishing the site to a production server.

To learn more about implementing $\LaTeX$ in markdown, check out the [documentation here](https://using-remark.gatsbyjs.org/katex/)

# $\LaTeX$ Examples

Consider the following list of k a's and l b's:

$$
\{\underbrace{%
    \overbrace{a,\ldots, a}^{k\ a's},
    \overbrace{b,\ldots, b}^{l\ b's}}
  _{k+l\ \mathrm{elements}}        \}
$$

Look further at this wild equation:

$$
\frac{\pm
  \left|\begin{array}{ccc}
  x_1-x_2   & y_1-y_2  \\
  l_1       & m_1
  \end{array}\right|}
  {\sqrt{\left|\begin{array}{cc}l_1&m_1\\
  l_2&m_2\end{array}\right|^2
  +       \left|\begin{array}{cc}m_1&n_1\\
  n_1&l_1\end{array}\right|^2}}
$$

# Code Examples

### Quotient and remainder of a pair of numbers in c++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  int divisor, dividend, quotient, remainder;

  cout << "Enter dividend: ";
  cin >> dividend;

  cout << "Enter divisor: ";
  cin >> divisor;

  quotient = dividend / divisor;
  remainder = dividend % divisor;

  cout << "Quotient = " << quotient << endl;
  cout << "Remainder = " << remainder;

  return 0;
}
```

### Sieve of Eratosthenes implemented in Python
```python
def countPrimes_sieve_of_eratosthenes(self, n: int) -> int:
  if n < 2:
      return 0

  marked = set()
  seive = [i for i in range(1, n)]
  skip = 2
  while skip * skip < n:
      if skip not in marked:
          marked.update(seive[2 * skip - 1 :: skip])
      skip += 1

  return len(seive) - len(marked) - 1
```
