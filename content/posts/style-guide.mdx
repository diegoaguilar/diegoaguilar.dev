## Text Elements

Body text looks like this and is using the [Computer Modern Web Fonts](https://github.com/aaaakshat/cm-web-fonts) (The same font that is used when typesetting in $\TeX$ or $\LaTeX$)

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

Text may be emphasised using _italics like this_ or **bolded text like this** using asterisks and underscores.

If you need to scratch some text out ~~like this~~ you can use double tildes (~~)

## Lists

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
   - Unordered sub-list.
3. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

   ⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

   ⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
   ⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
   ⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

- Unordered list can use asterisks (\*)

* Or minuses (-)

- Or pluses (+)

## Miscellaneous Features

### $\LaTeX$ and Code

### Blockquotes

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.

### Tables

While tables aren't fully supported just with mdx, they are functional and can be used to display organised data. However, I would recommend using $\LaTeX$ for tables due to the better formatting.

| Tables        |      Are      |   Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | -----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | \$1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   \$12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    \$1 |
