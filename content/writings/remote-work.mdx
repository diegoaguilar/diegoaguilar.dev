My opinion is biased by the fact that I quite never had to go to an office for work.

I can't talk in comparison to what it would be to go to an office every weekday, sort out commuting, and trying to stick to a strict given schedule and still get people staring at me when I get late.

I don't even really know what it's like to nod to a coworker who is behind or next to me neither feeling eyes watching over me prior to a deadline.

While this last sentence can be read as rhetoric, it makes me think that I've even had to come up with own personal and both mature and immature assumptions and understandings for what my impact on others in a team and their impressions and appreciation of my work.

There's something I do know, though. And this is that remote working demands a lot of self management and will. Also, I do know that remote working should not limit critically the perks of working in a common location.

I want to present a series of thoughts when it comes to remote working, most of them are related to communication and relationship with other members in a team. Same, I've tried to describe a realistic environment, more than an ideal and almost hypothetical cases.

**Routine**

We people need routines, we need to have a rough idea on stuff, we need frames. Even when it comes to slack and pleasure.

You're very free and welcomed to dress as you want at home, to work in the living room, in the dinning or kitchen table, to play a movie in the background while you work.

These are up to you, and are related to your own likes and so to your unique personality. That's fine.

I'd just add that all pleasure come with a certain cost if not an amount of debt. It's worth to consider adding a shape of routine and formality to the actions that can lead to either just bad or the greatest habits.

Being organized isn't opposite to have a relaxed mood and a comfortable and chill daily routine, whatever your style is.

**Change**

Creativity it's an expression of intelligence. Programming, design, management and HR work need of creativity. Arts and science are expressions of creativity. Creativity itself needs focus.

And routines may do a contrary. Routines without creativity are unhealthy. Change is the flexibility in routines.

Change leads to balance and is fuel for creativity.

**Balance**

Habits, routines, flexibility ... They all sound so great. But are a burden and boring if they're written in stone as a will and living in the air as a real commitment.

And, what's more, if ideal habits, routines and work recommendations don't obey our own personality, they'd just be unreal and idealistic behaviors.

Since you're reading this long, means that you're committed to improve yourself or simply that you're a quite critical person.

Critic aims the truth and truth follows fidelity to an idea, bad or good. So, critic yourself and keep a healthy balance on it.

**People**

We work for someone, our work is meant to be useful for someone. Make someone distract, happier, more efficient, more knowledgable. Something for someone.

Also, in some proportion, you're working with people. A pleasant fact or info hard enough to accept, how we relate to people tells *a lot* about ourselves.

Critic with balance leads to improvement and so, self critic with improvement leads to growth.

Being a solo collaborator, either a developer or any other creative work, makes work as pleasant as challenging. It can turn lonely or even might be a great chance to keep a balance between personal and professional life.

Truth is, remote work brings the fee of having to put attention to interpersonal skills. I'd remark a few key recommendations:

- Avoid assuming on other people's reactions and understandings
- Learn to listen and speak clearly
- Be kind but go up to the point
- Prior to an agreed time, learn to say *I don't know* or *I'll need some time to figure out*
- Take ownership of your work, by yourself, just do the right things that come alongside with your tasks and duties

Know the people you work with, understand about their culture and expectations from and on work. You don't need to know about their personal life before and after work, but having a grasp helps you understand a bit about their routines prior or during the time they get to work. People like to be understood.

**Roles**

Understand other people's roles. It's OK for managers and collaborators with a leadership role to ignore parts of the puzzle, even if those are relevant technical details.

They should focus on key parts, on stuff moving on and key components, they'd put attention to what seems to be raising a flag.

Clear and assertive communication help projects move on. Taking ownership of your work gives you freedom, real one, still respecting the agreements of the team.

Talk frankly and respectfully, work on your self confidence, be critic on your own work and that will pay back with a great relationship with others and in the end will make projects and teams succeed.

**Collaboration**

Consider that this idea that you think is so great and would improve it all, it will probably sound too challenging to a manager, a team lead, or even to the client. And guess what, they would be very right about think like that. 

Now think that perhaps being conservative in some proportion lead them to stand where they are at the moment. Big chances are that they're think of other requirements and constraints that you're missing.

As long as you take ownership of your own work, have communicated early and clearly and simply have a balanced confidence in your own work, your ideas will be taken in consideration and worth to try out. Remember to do the same with others ideas!

If you'd like to bring the attention of a coworker -whatever role this collaborator is performing- to discuss a topic that may be sensitive or comprehends the relationship with others in the team, or even just about his work, think twice about when the right moment to talk is.

Both compliment and ask for improvement early. If there's something you know it may be worth to discuss, put it on the table. Also, ask your coworkers and subordinates for their thoughts.

Newcomers to a team usually arrive with a great will to collaborate and get into action. It's always nice to be welcomed individually, in a natural and relaxed manner, but still respectful. Try it out, might work out great!

**Reality**

All work environments got issues and room for improvements. Technical, management and human related.

People won't always be kind. You're working, they are not your friends, yet they may became. Situations aren't always fair and pleasant.

Indeed, people wants to do their job and leave it alone for the day, even those who tend to overwork by own decision.

Critic yourself, aiming for balance, and things will get there.
